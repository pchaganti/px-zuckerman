# Contributing to Zuckerman

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Zuckerman! We value contributions that make the codebase simpler, cleaner, and more maintainable.

## What We Value Most

### 🗑️ Code Deletion (Our Top Priority)

**If you can remove code and make something more slim, that's what we value most.**

Before adding new features or code:
1. **Can this be done with less code?** Look for opportunities to simplify, consolidate, or remove unnecessary abstractions.
2. **Can we delete more than we add?** A contribution that removes 100 lines while adding 50 is better than one that adds 100 lines.
3. **Does this reduce complexity?** Every line of code is a liability. Less code means fewer bugs, easier maintenance, and faster understanding.

We're building an ultra-minimal AI agent. Every contribution should move us toward that goal.

### 🔄 Agent Fluency & Continuity (Second Priority)

**Making the agent work more fluently and continuously is our second most valued contribution.**

Contributions that improve agent capabilities should focus on:
1. **Smoother workflows** — reduce interruptions, eliminate friction points, enable seamless task completion
2. **Better continuity** — maintain context across interactions, preserve state, enable long-running operations
3. **Natural flow** — make the agent feel more responsive and capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks without breaking
4. **Reduced latency** — minimize delays, optimize hot-reloads, improve real-time responsiveness

The agent should feel like a natural extension of your workflow, not a tool that requires constant babysitting or restarts.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

- Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicate work
- For larger changes, consider opening an issue first to discuss the approach
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### Making Changes

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name
3. **Make your changes** — remember: deletion > addition
4. **Test your changes** — ensure existing functionality still works
5. **Commit** with clear, descriptive messages
6. **Push** and open a pull request

### Code Style

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Remove dead code, unused imports, and commented-out code
- Write code that's easy to delete later

### Pull Request Process

- Provide a clear description of what changed and why
- Highlight any code that was removed or simplified
- Ensure all tests pass
- Update documentation if needed

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue or start a discussion. We're here to help!

Remember: **Less code is better code. Deletion is the best contribution.**
